to start frontend
do 
>> npm i
>> npm run dev

to run backend
>> npm i
>> npm run start

database is already deployed on mongodb.com cluster and its credentials are available in .env file
I have not removed .env from .gitignore

I have not included much external package due to less time like for validation in frontend
